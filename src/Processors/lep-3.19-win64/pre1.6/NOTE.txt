Note 2022-04-30:

If you have Cygwin console https://www.cygwin.com/ installed in your comptuter, 
then it will probably be necessary to delete all the dlls from the / lep and /pre-1.6 folder

Apparently, with static compilation, the executable still fails to make Windows independent of dll's. I will keep researching.
