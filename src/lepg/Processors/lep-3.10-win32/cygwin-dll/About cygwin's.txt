ABOUT CYGWIN AND WINDOWS

CygwinXX.dll files are standard libraries used by some executable programs, originally written in FORTRAN and compiled in Windows on a Cygwin console.

If you want to run the program leparagliding (or others in fortram made in the Laboratori) on Windows systems, you will need some of these dlls copied to the same directory as the .exe

The main problem is knowing which dll you need. It depends on your operating system and processor. It mainly depends on whether it is a 32bit or 64 bit system. My advice is to test with different dll's until the program works.

There is a way to "avoid" using .dll libraries. It is about installing a cygwin console on your computer (then the system will use the native .dlls of your system). IF you want to do this, go to https://www.cygwin.com/ and install cygwin. It is important that you select to install all packages related to "fortran", in particular:

  f77
  fort77
  gfortran
  f2c
  gcc
  gcc-fortran

(and similars)

Then, go using the cygwin console to the /lep directory and run using:

./nameoftheprogram.exe

If you want to try to compile the source code yourself, do:

fort77 -Nn1604 sourccecode.f

or

gfortran sourcecode.f

or similar compiling instructions.

You get:

a.exe

Then run:

./a.exe
