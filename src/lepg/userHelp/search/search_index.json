Name gnuA2 The name of the design Leading edge definition 1 Leading edge type 1 a1= 641.92 b1= 194.02 x1= 340 x2= 490 xm= 527 c0= 28 ex1= 2.8 c02= 12 ex2= 4.0 The leading edge is defined by an ellipse of semiaxis a1 and b1 (red), centered at the point (0.0). Xm is half span. In versions 1.4 and earlier it is only possible to modify the ellipses with a parabolic correction (degree 2). Now it is possible to make two corrections with a generic curve of degree N. The first correction begins at the point x1 and allows a deflection c01, with a variation of degree ex1. The second correction begins at the point x2 > x1 and allows a deflection c02, with a variation of degree ex2. Trailing edge definition 1 Trailing edge type 1 a1= 643.28 b1= 140.5 x1= 180 xm= 527 c0= -8.9 y0= 88.06 exp= 1.5 The trailing edge is defined by an ellipse of semiaxis a1 and b1 (green), centered at the point (0,y0). Xm is half span. In versions 1.4 and earlier it is only possible to modify the ellipses with a parabolic correction (degree 2). Now it is possible to make correction with a generic curve of degree N. The correction begins at the point x1 and allows a deflection c0, with a variation of degree exp. Vault definition Vault Type 1 1 Type 1: vault using ellipse and cosinus modification, indicate parameters a1, b1. a1= 414.2901 semiaxis a b1= 237.4300 semiaxis b x1= 265.3489 point where start ellipse modification c1= 28.22 increased half span The shape of the vault is an ellipse of semiaxis a1 (horizontal) and b1 (vertical), but with a modification with a \"cosine type function\", from point x1 of the horizontal axis. Half of the span is increased by an amount c1. for all y in [0,b1]: If x < x1 then: x=a1*sqrt(1-((y*y)/(b1*b1))) If x >= x1 then: x=a1*sqrt(1-((y*y)/(b1*b1)))+c1*(1-cos(((y1-y)/y1)*0.5*pi) Verification: for y=0 x=a1 sqrt(1-((y y)/(b1 b1)))+c1 1 for y=y1 x=a1 sqrt(1-((y y)/(b1 b1)))+c1 0 where y1=b1 sqrt(1-((x1 x1)/(a1*a1))) Attached drawing explains: Vault Type 2 2 Type 2: vault using four tangent circles.
