During startup lepg checks if there is a new version available.

You have the following configuration possibilities: 

* With the checkbox you can deactivate the check. You will no more be informed if there is a newer version available. 

* Branch: lepg is available in two versions

  * stable: the version you should use. Here you shold get a version which all functions available fully implemented. 
  
  * latest: latest and greatest version. Be careful, here all the development starts, you might get functionality which is not yet fully implemend and buggy.
